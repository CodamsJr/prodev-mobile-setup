# prodev-mobile-setup

## Steps Followed

1. Created GitHub repository: `prodev-mobile-setup`.
2. Created project folder `prodev-mobile-app-0x00`.
3. Created Expo Router app structure files:
   - `app-example/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
   - `app-example/app/constants/Colors.tsx`
4. Modified home screen text from "Welcome!" to "First App Created".
5. Documented what would happen if the app was run.

## Reset Project Observation

Running `npm run reset-project` (hypothetical):
- Would delete node_modules and cached files.
- Reinstall dependencies.
- Refresh the app to default state.
